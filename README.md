# Islamic-Hadith-Project-AI
Job Title: AI Engineer - Advancing the Islamic Sciences with AI
Location: Remote
FIXED Budget: 5 USD FOR THE WHOLE PROJECT (we are NON PROFIT)

Answer the Call to Serve Islam Through Technology
Do you dream of using your technical expertise to strengthen and preserve the sacred sciences of Islam? Are you inspired by the opportunity to merge cutting-edge technology with the timeless wisdom of our beloved Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him)? Join us on this groundbreaking mission to revolutionize the study of Hadith using state-of-the-art  AI techniques.

This is not just a role; it is a fardh kifayah, a collective responsibility to serve the Ummah and earn eternal rewards. Every algorithm you build and every dataset you process will be a step toward safeguarding the authenticity and integrity of the words and teachings of the Prophet (peace be upon him) for generations to come.

“And whatever good you put forward for yourselves – you will find it with Allah. It is better and greater in reward.” (Quran, 73:20)
May Allah bless and reward your efforts. We look forward to welcoming you to our team!

It’s inspiring to see a project that blends AI technology with the preservation and advancement of the Islamic sciences. Here’s a breakdown of how an AI Engineer can contribute to this noble mission, specifically focusing on applying AI techniques to Hadith analysis and Islamic knowledge.

To implement such a project, we can focus on a few critical areas:
1. Data Collection and Preprocessing

You may need a dataset of Hadiths (authentic sayings of the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him). These datasets can be preprocessed to remove inconsistencies or errors, tokenize text, and classify the Hadiths based on authenticity (Sahih, Da'if, etc.).
2. Text Classification and Natural Language Processing (NLP)

You can apply NLP techniques to classify Hadiths, extract key phrases, identify related themes, and understand the sentiment behind the text. NLP will be key in automatically assessing the authenticity of Hadiths, assisting in making informed decisions on categorization.
3. AI Algorithms for Authenticity Prediction

You can leverage machine learning models (e.g., deep learning, SVMs, Naive Bayes) to train algorithms that can classify Hadiths based on their authenticity, given sufficient labeled training data.
4. Semantic Search

For deeper access to the Hadiths, an AI-powered semantic search system could help users search and understand relevant Hadiths based on meaning rather than simple keyword matching.
Example Python Code for a Basic NLP and Text Classification Setup:

This example demonstrates how to classify a dataset of Hadiths using a basic text classification model. We’ll use Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) to process the Hadiths. You can extend this to more complex models such as BERT for Islamic text classification.
Prerequisites:

Install necessary libraries:

pip install pandas scikit-learn nltk tensorflow

Step-by-Step Python Code:

import pandas as pd
import nltk
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report

# Sample Hadith dataset (For example purposes, this would ideally be a much larger dataset)
data = {
    'Hadith': [
        "The best of you are those who learn the Qur'an and teach it.",
        "Whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day should speak good or remain silent.",
        "Actions are judged by intentions.",
        "The strong person is not the one who can overpower others, but the one who controls himself when angry."
    ],
    'Category': ['Sahih', 'Sahih', 'Weak', 'Sahih']  # Category can be 'Sahih', 'Da'if', etc.
}

# Convert data into a DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Preprocess text using NLTK for tokenization (simple example)
nltk.download('punkt')
df['Tokenized_Hadith'] = df['Hadith'].apply(lambda x: nltk.word_tokenize(x.lower()))

# TF-IDF vectorization to convert text into numerical format
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(df['Hadith'])

# Labels (target) for training - 'Sahih', 'Da'if' etc.
y = df['Category']

# Split dataset into train and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train a Naive Bayes classifier (for simplicity)
model = MultinomialNB()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)}')
print('Classification Report:\n', classification_report(y_test, y_pred))

# Sample Prediction
sample_hadith = ["The one who does not thank people does not thank Allah."]
sample_vectorized = vectorizer.transform(sample_hadith)
prediction = model.predict(sample_vectorized)
print(f"Predicted category for the sample Hadith: {prediction[0]}")

Breakdown of the Code:

    Dataset: We start with a small sample dataset (df), where each Hadith is labeled as Sahih or Weak (you could extend the labels).

    Text Preprocessing: We tokenize the Hadiths using NLTK. In practice, you would need a more robust text cleaning process, including stemming or lemmatization, removing stop words, etc.

    Vectorization: The TfidfVectorizer is used to convert text data into numerical features that can be fed into machine learning models. TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) is useful for text classification tasks.

    Model Training: We train a simple Naive Bayes classifier (MultinomialNB) to classify Hadiths based on the authenticity.

    Evaluation: We evaluate the model’s performance using accuracy and classification report metrics, which give a breakdown of precision, recall, and F1-score.

    Prediction: Finally, we predict the category of a sample Hadith.

Step 5: Extending This to a Full Project

This basic script could be expanded and enhanced with the following:

    Larger Dataset: A larger dataset of Hadiths, labeled according to their authenticity (Sahih, Da'if, Hasan, etc.), would improve the model's performance.

    Deep Learning: You could extend this with more advanced models like LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory networks) or BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) to handle the complexity and semantic nature of Hadith text.

    Natural Language Generation (NLG): You could use deep learning models for generating summaries or generating new Hadith-like statements to assist scholars or learners.

    Real-time Search Interface: Build an interactive interface using Flask or Django (Python web frameworks) to serve the Hadiths and their classifications via a web API.

    Ethical and Scholarly Review: Collaborate with scholars to continuously review and improve the model’s accuracy in classifying Hadiths, ensuring the AI system remains aligned with Islamic teachings.

Conclusion

This project will contribute to the preservation and understanding of the Islamic sciences through the use of AI. The approach shown here is just a start. By expanding datasets, implementing more advanced NLP techniques, and integrating other deep learning models, this AI system can grow into an invaluable resource for the Ummah, helping scholars and students alike to study, understand, and preserve the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).

May your efforts be blessed and lead to positive contributions to the Ummah!
